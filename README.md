# iris-classification-test
### describe the data :
There are 150 observations with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
There are no null values, so we don't have to worry about that.
There are 50 observations of each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

### context :
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
